    "interestingFunFact": "When I was a young child, around seven or eight years old, I went downtown with my family. We spent the day shopping and exploring, moving from one store to another. The streets were crowded, and in the excitement, I must have wandered off without realizing it. At one point, I glanced around and suddenly felt a wave of panic—I couldn't see my family anywhere. Somehow, I had started walking alongside a stranger, assuming he was part of my family group. I was small and hadn't looked up, just following along by his side. I walked with him for quite a while, feeling comfortable and secure in the thought that I was with someone familiar. I wasn't very talkative, so I just looked around, quietly enjoying the sights. Suddenly, I heard a familiar voice calling my name from a distance. The voice called twice, and I wondered, 'Are they calling me?' The voice sounded similar to the person I thought I was walking with, adding to my confusion. Then I looked up at the person beside me, and to my surprise, I saw a stranger's face. A rush of fear hit me, but relief washed over me as I spotted my uncle waving nearby. I immediately sprinted toward him.",
